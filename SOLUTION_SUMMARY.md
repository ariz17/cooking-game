# Cooking Game Backend Server Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem
The cooking game's backend server wasn't loading properly, preventing the frontend from connecting to it and loading game data.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Duplicate Project Structure**: There was a confusing duplicate directory structure in `backend/src/src/` that was causing issues
2. **Incorrect Error Message**: The frontend was showing port 8081 in an error message when the backend was actually configured for port 3000

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cleaned Up Duplicate Directory Structure
- Removed the confusing `backend/src/src/` directory
- This ensures there's only one source of truth for the backend code

### 2. Fixed Incorrect Error Message
- Updated `frontend/static/script.js` line 178
- Changed error message from "Please ensure the backend server is running on port 8081" to "Please ensure the backend server is running on port 3000"

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation
- `README.md`: Complete setup and startup instructions
- `TESTING.md`: Detailed testing guide with automated scripts

## Solution Verification

### Files Modified
1. `frontend/static/script.js` - Fixed incorrect port in error message
2. `README.md` - Complete setup instructions
3. `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide

### How to Test the Solution

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install  # If you haven't already
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Connection**:
   - Open browser to http://localhost:3001
   - You should see "Connected to backend successfully!" in green
   - Game data should load and you can play the game

### Automated Testing
The `TESTING.md` file includes scripts to automatically verify:
- Backend health endpoint accessibility
- Backend game data endpoint functionality
- Frontend server availability

## Success Criteria
When everything is working correctly, you should see:
1. Backend server running on port 3000
2. Frontend server running on port 3001
3. Frontend successfully connecting to backend
4. Game data loading correctly
5. Ability to play the game without errors
